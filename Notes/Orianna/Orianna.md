# Orianna Abilities

## Passive - Functioning

Notes:
* I pulled this info from the Wiki and as far as info listed there it looks like her passive has had many changes to its damage ratios if at all.
**Bonus: On-Hit Magic Damage**

| Level | Damage |
|:-----:|:-----:|
|  1 | 10 + (15% AP) |
|  4 | 18 + (15% AP) |
|  7 | 26 + (15% AP) |
| 10 | 34 + (15% AP) |
| 13 | 42 + (15% AP) |
| 16 | 50 + (15% AP) |

**Ramping Damage**

| Level | Damage: 1 Stack | Damage: 2 Stacks|
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
|  1 |  2.0 + (3% AP) |  4.0 + (3% AP) |
|  4 |  3.6 + (3% AP) |  7.2 + (3% AP) |
|  7 |  5.2 + (3% AP) | 10.4 + (3% AP) |
| 10 |  6.8 + (3% AP) | 13.6 + (3% AP) |
| 13 |  8.4 + (3% AP) | 16.8 + (3% AP) |
| 16 | 10.0 + (3% AP) | 20.0 + (3% AP) |

Notes:
* Ramp damage applies at the same time the target is aa for a second time.
* Stack should removed the moment the aa target is changed and not apply any ramped damage.

**On-Hit Damage + Ramping Damage**

These should be the damage numbers **_after_** the first auto-attack on the same targer.

| Level | Damage: 1 Stack | Damage: 2 Stacks|
|:-----:|:-----:|:-----:|
|  1 | 12.0 + (17% AP) | 14.0 + (17% AP) |
|  4 | 21.6 + (17% AP) | 25.2 + (17% AP) |
|  7 | 31.2 + (17% AP) | 36.4 + (17% AP) |
| 10 | 40.8 + (17% AP) | 47.6 + (17% AP) |
| 13 | 50.4 + (17% AP) | 58.8 + (17% AP) |
| 16 | 60.0 + (17% AP) | 70.0 + (17% AP) |
